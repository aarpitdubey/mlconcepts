**Artificial Intelligence:** It deal with building complex systems that intimate, intelligent human behavior, for example a self driven cars - It have sensors to capture the images. Those images goes to the Machine Learning model hat might be using something called as deep learning models to detect where is the obstacles and in what way the car should move ahead.

It's doing multiple things - It's a complex system which includes Planning, Object detection, NLP, machine Learning, deep learning and other stuff.

**Machine Learning:** It is a subset of AI. Here, we build Algorithms that can learn and improve from experiences. basically, we feed some data to the ML model. the model is going to learn from that data and it's going better and better at performing certain task. For example a weather forecast or wan to predict the price of the house.

**Deep Learning:** It's subset and a specialized area  in machine Learning where we build more complex models based on the idea of neural networks. for example - classifying images or detecting where the object is present

## Machine Learning

- It covers a range of statistical techniques giving computers the ability to learn from data.
- Create a statistical model to mimic "Intelligent" business decision making.
- Finding patterns in complex, scattered data to present information.

## Deep Learning

- Deep Learning using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) which are more complex models and can be trained for specific tasks.
- Deep Learning models are data hungry and are more computationally expensive.

## Computer Vision

- Computer Vision is an inter-disciplinary field concerning how computers can see and understand digital images and videos.
- Examples - Facial Recognition, Image Segmentation, Object Detection

## Natural Language Processing

- Natural Language Processing (NLP) deals with the interactions between computers and human (natural) language.

NLP separates into two sub-categories:

1. Natural-Language Understanding
2. Natural-Language Generation

## Reinforcement Learning

- The goal of reinforcement learning is to train an agent to complete a task within an uncertain environemnt.
- The agent receives observations and a reward from the environment and sends actions to the environment.
- The reward measures how successful action is with respect to completing a task (or) our goal.
