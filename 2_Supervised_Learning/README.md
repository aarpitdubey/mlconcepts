# Supervised Learning

- In supervised learning, we use labeled datasets (training examples and their associated correct labels) to train algorithms that to classify data (or) predict outcomes accurately.
- **Regression** and **Classification** are two tasks of supervised learning.
- **Regression:**  Predict a **countinuous numeric value,** example how much that house sell for? predicting house prices.
- **Classification:** Assign a label, Is this a Dog or cat or human and of what breed?

Example:

Let's examine the problem of predicting student's marks based upon number of hours student has put in studying before the exam.

**Solution:** Let's out to find a common pattern or comman function, f(X) which gives us the value of Y.

f(X) = y Hence, if f(5) = 15,

 f(3) = 10, 

f(4) = 13 and 

f(11) = 34 then, 

the **f(X) = 3 *** **X + 1** is the fuction w.r.t to X so, y = 3 * X + 1
