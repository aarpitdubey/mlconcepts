# Linear Regression

- Linear Regression is also known as **Ordinary Least Squares.**
- Regression predicts a **countinuous value**. Now we will build an algorithm that solves the task of predicting marks given a labelled dataset.
- The goal of the algorithm is to learn a **linear model** that predicts a ***y** for an unseen **x** with minimum error*.

  **Input (X) :** It is the independent feature or **input feature** which is **Time Spent**.

  **Output (Y) :** It is the dependent feature (or) the **target** variable which is **Marks**.

#### Equation of Line: Y = m * x + c

where, m is the slope, c is the intercept and x is the coefficient.

## Hypothesis

**Step 1: Assume a Hypothesis function**

- Linear Regression is a **parametric method**, which means it makes an assumption about the form of the function relating X and Y. So, we decide to approximate **y** as a linear function of **x**
